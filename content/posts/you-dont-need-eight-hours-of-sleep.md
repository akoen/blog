I've always struggled with my sleep. For years, I would spend hours lying awake, wondering how I could possibly feel so alert when hours earlier I was dozing off on the couch. Why was it that as sleepy as I felt, my brain just wouldn't shut off?

The quality of my sleep varied sinusoidaly throughout the years. Sometimes—especially when I was travelling or exercising intensely—sleep was effortless; I barely thought about it. By contrast, when I was in school and under pressure, my sleep would, like a sine wave slowly reaching its minimum, slowly degrade to the point where I would feel perpetually dysfunctional.

Naturally, the more sleep I lost, the more time I gave myself in bed. I retired no later than 10:00 pm, allocating myself eight hours of well-earned rest before my alarm would sound just after six. That rest did not come, however, for there I would lay, waiting for the sun to rise. Frustrated at my brain's inability to power off, and like countless of my sleepless companions, I became reliant on an entire bouquet of colourful over-the-counter medications, mostly low-dose melatonin (which, surprisingly, is far more effective than the standard dosage.)

# The Solution

In April, I embarked on a mission to understand the root of my sleep troubles, and have come away with two key lessons which have dramatically improved the quality of my sleep.

1. **Make your room pitch black, and soundproof.** This seems self-evident, but for me it was critical. My university dorm lacked in exactly two ways: It had a *terrible* colour scheme, and it was neither dark nor soundproof. The light from the hallway and sporadic ululations of my neighbours significantly detracted from my sleep quality, and it was only when I moved back home and installed blackout curtains that I noticed the improvement.

*Lesson: make it dark, and make it quiet.*

2. **The reason you can't fall asleep is because you're not sleepy.** Everybody sleeps. Like food, like water, and like oxygen, your body demands sleep, and the longer you stay awake, the sleepier you get. Eventually, no matter how many coffees you've drank, or how great your fears are about the next day, your *will* sleep, because it's outside of your control—you depend on it to survive.

You might ask: "If my body sleeps when it needs to, and the longer I stay awake the sleepier I get, then why can I go to bed completely wrecked from my tap dancing class and find myself completely unable to fall asleep?". The answer to this is that you're expecting sleep when your body doesn't actually need it. It is easy to confuse being sleepy with being fatigued. Broadly, sleepiness is your body's response to increases in its levels of the hormones adenosine, which increases the longer you stay awake, and melatonin, which increases in the evening. Conversely, the feeling you get after a session of high speed pirouetting is fatigue, or a lack of energy. It is important to realize that these are not synonymous, and that sleep is not necessarily the answer to fatigue.

# You don't need eight hours of sleep.

The second, more likely cause is that you're getting *too much* sleep. Most adults need 6–7 hours per night at *most*, and sleeping more comes at the cost of reduced sleep quality, resulting in a general feeling of lethargy. This is paradoxical, but if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and the way you feel the next day, go to bed later. My habit of going to bed earlier because I couldn't sleep was no different than eating dinner earlier because I wasn't hungry. Now, I typically go to bed around 11:00 pm, an hour later. Not only does this give me more time in my day to be unproductive, but I fall asleep faster, do not depend on pills, and feel less like a squash the next day. This simple routine has dramatically improved my life.

*Most of what I have learned has come from the excellent book The Sleep Solution by Dr. Chris Winter. Not only is it highly informative, but the author has a refined sense of humour making it very readable. Check it out.*
