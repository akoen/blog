Hi, I'm Alex. I'm nineteen years old and currently studying engineering at the Universtiy of British Columbia. To me, writing is the most effective way to understand anything. It forces us to confront inconsistencies in our thinking, distill our thinking into words, and then present those words so that they can be understood by others. If I cannot do this, I do not understand the subject. 

As always, I would love to hear from you. It does not necessarily have to relate to anything on this blog, or even to anything in particularâ€”there is nothing more special to me than meeting new people.

Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:alex@koen.ca).
